"من ظاهرِ نیستی و هستی دانم،\nمن باطنِ هر فراز و پستی دانم؛\nبا این‌همه از دانشِ خود شَرْمَم باد،\nگر مرتبه‌ای وَرایِ مستی دانم","Man zāher-e nisti o hasti dānam,\nMan bāten-e har farāz o pasti dānam;\nBa in hame az dānesh-e khod sharmam bād,\nGar martabeh-ee varāye masti dānam.","I have a superficial awareness of both absence and presence,\nBut I deeply comprehend every high and low.\nYet, despite this understanding, I feel ashamed of my wisdom,\nIf I perceive any state beyond drunkenness.","1. I understand the basic concept of existence and non-existence.\n2. I grasp the deeper meaning of life's ups and downs.\n3. Despite all my knowledge, I am humbled and ashamed by it.\n4. If I think there is a higher truth beyond drunkenness, which refers to an experience where one lives in the moment, fully enjoys it, and does not worry about the past or future.","The poem implies that despite our vast knowledge and understanding of the world, true wisdom may lie in embracing the present moment. It suggests that rather than constantly seeking deeper truths or getting caught up in the complexities of existence, we might find fulfillment in living fully in the now, free from anxieties about the past or future. This resonates with the modern emphasis on mindfulness and the search for meaning beyond material success or intellectual achievement.","I know the seen and unseen, existence I embrace,\nI comprehend the inner depths and the surface's grace;\nYet, my knowledge brings shame and a modest quest,\nYearning for insights beyond, an intoxicated space.","من ظاهرِ نیستی و هستی دانم","I have a superficial awareness of both absence and presence"
