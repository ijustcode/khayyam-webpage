# Sectional static website

We are building a static website. It consists of a single page. From top to bottom these are the components of the page:

- Lyrics in Farsi
- Transliteration of lyrics to English
- Poetic transliteration of lyrics to English
- Comment section (both adding and fetching) at the bottom



Todo:
- move to a serving platform
- remove secrets from plain HTML
